## Read: JavaScript and jQuery Pages 43-69

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript *the three languages of a website*

- HTML `<html>` *provides the structure and content of a web page*
- CSS `{css}` *styles the webpage and defines how the content is displayed*
- JS `javascript()` *controls how the page behaves*
- Attempt to maintain a seperate file for each layer as much as possible
- Progressive Enhancement *popular approach to building web pages, each layer improves on the one before it*

JavaScript *plain text language so it does not require any additional tools to start*
