### Process and Design

- When creating a website, create fictional visitors complete with a variety of target demographic information. Use them to drive design choices.
- What are the primary motivations and goals of users of your site?
- What information do your users need?
- How often a site should be updated may depend on content and frequency of user visits.
- Card sorting is a methode of determining page and content layout.
- Wireframe *simple sketch that covers the primary info and structure needed for each page*
- Good idea to show wireframe to client prior to showing design, this ensures that content and functionality drive the page build.

Visual Hierarchy *most users do not read entire web pages. Using contrast can help focus a users attention.*

- Size *larger elements grab attention*
- Color *differences between foreground and background color can draw attention*
- Style *changine the style of an element in relation to is adjacent items helps it to stand out*

Grouping and Similarity *visually grouping items of related content through similar element styles*

- Proximity *placing related elements close together*
- Closure *a real or imaginary box that can be drawn around related elements*
- Continuance *items in a line or continous curve are precieved as more related than those that are not*
- White Space *intentionally using gaps to deliniate different groups of elements*
- Color *background color placed behind related items*
- Borders *line drawn around related elements*

Navigation *a good design allows users to better find and understand your content*

- Concise *quick and easy to read, ideally no more than 8 links or options in a menu*
- Clear *predictable outcomes based on link descriptions*
- Selective *primary navigation should only focus on navigation not other items such as login*
- Context *good navigation indicates to the user where they are in relation to the site overall*
- Interactive *links should be physically easy to use and differenciate from other text on the screen*
- Consistent *keep the primary navigation structure the same throughout*
