Structural Markup *used to describe headings and paragraphs*

Text Emphasis, Line Breaks, and Horizontal Rules

- `<b></b>` **Bolds text**
- `<i></i>` *italic*
- `<sup></sup>` Superscript
- `<sub></sub>` Subscript
- `<br />` Creates a line break in the text
- `<hr />` Creates a horizontal rule

White space condensing *multiple spaces in a row are condensed to a single space, multiple blank rows are condensed to a single blank row*

Semantic Tags

- `<strong></strong>` Emphasis on text between the tags, browser will default to bold
- `<em></em>` Emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence, browser defaults to italics
- `<blockquote></blockquote>` Used for quotes that take up more than one line, browsers will likely indent text by default
- `<q></q>` Inline quote, browser should add in quotes, but not all do
- `<abbr></abbr>` Abbreviation tag shows full description of a short form
  - Example: `<abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr>`
- `<cite></cite>` Citation used to indicate where a citation if from, will render in *italics*
- `<dfn></dfn>` Definition, used when first explaining new terminology
- `<address></address>` Contains the contact information for the author of the page
- `<ins></ins>` Used to show content that was inserted into a page
- `<del></del>` Used to show content that was deleted from a page
- `<s></s>` Element that indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant but should not be deleted, shown as strikethrough text
