## HTML Chapter 2: Pages 40-61

Structural Markup *used to describe headings and paragraphs*
Semantic Markup *provides extra information and emphasis on certain parts of a sentence or paragraph*

Text Emphasis, Line Breaks, and Horizontal Rules

- `<b></b>` **Bolds text**
- `<i></i>` *italic*
- `<sup></sup>` Superscript
- `<sub></sub>` Subscript
- `<br />` Creates a line break in the text
- `<hr />` Creates a horizontal rule

White space condensing *multiple spaces in a row are condensed to a single space, multiple blank rows are condensed to a single blank row*

Semantic Tags

- `<strong></strong>` Emphasis on text between the tags, browser will default to bold
- `<em></em>` Emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence, browser defaults to italics
- `<blockquote></blockquote>` Used for quotes that take up more than one line, browsers will likely indent text by default
- `<q></q>` Inline quote, browser should add in quotes, but not all do
- `<abbr></abbr>` Abbreviation tag shows full description of a short form
  - Example: `<abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr>`
- `<cite></cite>` Citation used to indicate where a citation if from, will render in *italics*
- `<dfn></dfn>` Definition, used when first explaining new terminology
- `<address></address>` Contains the contact information for the author of the page
- `<ins></ins>` Used to show content that was inserted into a page
- `<del></del>` Used to show content that was deleted from a page
- `<s></s>` Element that indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant but should not be deleted, shown as strikethrough text

## HTML Chapter 10: Pages 226-245

CSS *allows the programmer to create rules that determine how each element box is presented*

- Associates a style rule with an html element
  - Example: `p{font-family: Arial;}`
    - `p` *selector, in this case indicating all `<p>` tags*
    - `{font-family: Arial;}` *declaration, setting text font to arial*
    - `font-family:` *property, indicates the aspect of the element to be controlled*
    - `arial;` *value, specific setting to be used*

To link style.css doc to index.html, use similar code in the html doc:

```html

<head>
    <link href="css/example.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
</html>

```

To control styles in an html doc, use `<style></style>` tags

```html

<style type="text/css">
    body{
        font-family: arial;
        background-color: rgb(255,255,255);
    }
</style>

```

**Full chart of css selectors can be found on page 238**

CSS Rule Cascade

- Last Rule *if two selectors are identical, the one furthest down the document will take precedence*
- Specificity *more specific rules out rank less specific*
- Important `!important` *can add the `!important` after any property value to force it to take precedence*
  - Example: `p{color: blue !important;}`

## JS Chapter 2: Pages 53-84

Statement *each individual step that the computer is intended to follow, ends with a `;`*

Comments *programmer side notes that are used to convey code intent for easier debugging and future updating*

- In VS Code use `cmd+/` to automatically comment a line

Variable *a data storage unit*

- Must be declared before they can be used
- `var quantity;` *declaring the variable named quantity*
- `quantity = 3;` *assigning the value `3` to the variable `quantity`*

Data Types

Numeric Data Types | String Data Types | Boolean Data Types
--- | --- | ---
Example = `0.75` | Example = `'Hi, Ivy!'` | Example = `true`
For tasks involving counting or sums | Enclosed in a pair of single or double quotes used for working with text | True / False

Strings must always be surrounded by quotes either `"string"` or `'string'` but not a combination. It must also be on one line.

6 Rules for naming variables

1. must begin with a letter, dollar sign `$`, or underscore `_`
2. no dashes `-`, or dots `.` are allowed in a name
3. no **keywords** or **reserved words** are allowed
4. names are case sensitive
5. create a name that represents the information it stores
6. use camelCase for names with more than one word

Array *a variable that stores a list of values*

- Programmer does not have to specificity how many variables it will hold
- Declare an array similar to other variables, but assign the value using `[]` and comma separated items
  - Example: `var colors = ['white', 'black', 'custom'];` *this format is known as an **array literal**, this is the preferred method*
  - Example: `var colors = new Array('white', 'black', 'custom');` *this format is know as an **array conductor***
- Can use different data types in the same array
- Items in an array are automatically assigned an *index* number indicating its position, count starts with `0` not `1`
  - From the example above: Index `0` is `'white'`, `1` is `'black'`, and `2` is `'custom'`
- To access a specific item in an array use the form `arrayName[index number]`
  - Example: `var itemThree = colors[2]` *sets variable `itemThree` to `'custom'`*
- Number of items in an array is a property of each array to access it use `arrayName.length;`
  - Example: `var numColors = colors.length;`
- To change a specific value in an array `arrayName[index number] = 'new value';`
  - Example: `colors[2] = 'beige';` *changes the third array item from `'custom'` to `'beige'`*

Expressions evaluate into a single value

- First type are expressions that just assign a value to a variable
  - Example: `var color = 'beige';` *The value of color is now beige*
- The second type are expressions that  use two or more values to return a single value
  - Exampele: `var area = 3 * 2` *The value of area is now 6*

Operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values

- Assignment operators *assign a value to a variable
  - Example: `var color = 'beige';` *The value of color is now beige*
- Arithmetic operators *perform basic math*
  - Example: `area = 3 * 2` *The value of area is now 6*
- String Operators *combine two strings*
  - Example: `greeting = 'Hi ' + 'Molly';`
- Comparison Operators *compare two values and return true or false*
  - Example: `buy = 3 > 5;` *Value of buy is now false*
- Logical Operators *combine expressions and return true or false*
  - `buy = (5>3) && (2<4);` *The value of buy is now true*

Arithmetic Operators *JS contains the standard operators `+, -, /, *` which can be used with numbers as well as the following special operators*

- `++` *(Increment) adds one to the current number*
- `--` *(Decrement) subtracts one from the current number*
- `%` *(Modulus) divides two values and returns the remainder example: `10 % 3 = 1`*

String Operator *just one operator `+` used to join strings on either side*
 
- Concatenation *the joining of two or more strings to form one new string*

Mixing numbers and strings

- Quotes around a number (`#`) create a string, not a numeric number type. Arithmetic operators cannot be used on strings
  - Example: `'2' + '2' = '22'` *Adding strings concatenates them, it does not add.*
  - Example: `12 + 'Bob' = '12Bob'` *Adding a number to a string, creates a new concatenated string*
  - Example: `'seven' * 'nine' = NaN` *(Not a Number) attempting to use arithmetic operators on strings will return a value called NaN*
