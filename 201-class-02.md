## HTML Chapter 2: Pages 40-61

Structural Markup *used to describe headings and paragraphs*
Semantic Markup *provides extra information and emphasis on certain parts of a sentence or paragraph*

Text Emphasis, Line Breaks, and Horizontal Rules

- `<b></b>` **Bolds text**
- `<i></i>` *italic*
- `<sup></sup>` Superscript
- `<sub></sub>` Subscript
- `<br />` Creates a line break in the text
- `<hr />` Creates a horizontal rule

White space condensing *multiple spaces in a row are condensed to a single space, multiple blank rows are condensed to a single blank row*

Semantic Tags

- `<strong></strong>` Emphasis on text between the tags, browser will default to bold
- `<em></em>` Emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence, browser defaults to italics
- `<blockquote></blockquote>` Used for quotes that take up more than one line, browsers will likely indent text by default
- `<q></q>` Inline quote, browser should add in quotes, but not all do
- `<abbr></abbr>` Abbreviation tag shows full description of a short form
  - Example: `<abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr>`
- `<cite></cite>` Citation used to indicate where a citation if from, will render in *italics*
- `<dfn></dfn>` Definition, used when first explaining new terminology
- `<address></address>` Contains the contact information for the author of the page
- `<ins></ins>` Used to show content that was inserted into a page
- `<del></del>` Used to show content that was deleted from a page
- `<s></s>` Element that indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant but should not be deleted, shown as strikethrough text

## HTML Chapter 10: Pages 226-245

CSS *allows the programmer to create rules that determine how each element box is presented*

- Associates a style rule with an html element
  - Example: `p{font-family: Arial;}`
    - `p` *selector, in this case indicating all `<p>` tags*
    - `{font-family: Arial;}` *declaration, setting text font to arial*
    - `font-family:` *property, indicates the aspect of the element to be controlled*
    - `arial;` *value, specific setting to be used*

To link style.css doc to index.html, use similar code in the html doc:

```html

<head>
    <link href="css/example.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
</html>

```

To control styles in an html doc, use `<style></style>` tags

```html

<style type="text/css">
    body{
        font-family: arial;
        background-color: rgb(255,255,255);
    }
</style>

```

**Full chart of css selectors can be found on page 238**

CSS Rule Cascade

- Last Rule *if two selectors are identical, the one furthest down the document will take precedence*
- Specificity *more specific rules out rank less specific*
- Important `!important` *can add the `!important` after any property value to force it to take precedence*
  - Example: `p{color: blue !important;}`
