# Code 401: Class 27 - Props and State

***

## Questions

1. Does a deployed React application require a server? *A server is not explicitly required for deploying a React app.*

2. Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than unit level? *Unit testing is good for confirming that an algorithm will always produce the desired result, but React apps are created to generate a user experience and it is more crucial that each state is rendered correctly at the correct time.*

3. What does `npm run build` do? *This command creates a `build` directory that houses a production build of the app.*

4. Describe the actual composition/architecture of a React application.

- Title & Favicon: Browser tab label and thumbnail
- Router: Provides navigation through the DOM
- Material UI & Robot Font: Allows the use of prebuilt customizable components
- Backend Connectivity: Defines how the app interfaces with outside resources
- Redux & Thunk: Provisions the app level state, thunk works with redux to handle side effects like outside resource fetching
- Multi-Environment Setup: Defining dynamic configuration parameters via env variables
- Internationalization: `react-i18next` is a library that provides tools for multilingual support
- Unit testing: Jest works well for testing React apps
- Deployment: Must deploy the final `/build` directory

## Vocabulary

- BDD *Behavior Driven Development, develope based on user behavior*

- Acceptance Tests *Determining whether design requirements have been achieved*

## Read: [Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

- Components allow the UI to be split in to independent, reuseable pieces, similar to JS functions
- Simplest form: `function Welcome(props) {return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>}`
- `props` = properties
- ES6 class: `class Welcome extends React.Component { render () { return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>; }}`
- Always capitalize component names
- All React components must act like pure functions regarding their props

## Read: [State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

- "mounting" - rendering an item to the DOM for the first time
- "unmounting" - when an DOM element is removed
- "lifecycle methods" - methods that occur on mounting or unmounting
- `componentDidMount()` *runs after a component output is rendered to the DOM*
- `componentWillUnmount()` *teardown an unused element*
- Incorrect: `this.state.comment = 'Hello';`
- Correct: `this.setState({comment: 'Hello'});`

## Read: [Form](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

- In HTML a `<textarea>` tag defines its text as a child, React uses the value attribute

## Read: [Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)

- React events are named with camelCase
- Simple example: `<button on Click={activateLasers}> Activate Lasers </button>`
- returning default does not prevent default behavior in React, must use e.preventDefault();

## Read: [Understanding React 'setState](https://css-tricks.com/understanding-react-setstate/)

- `setState()` is the only legitimate way to update state after it has been initialized
- Reconciliation *how react updates the DOM, only updates the parts that have changed*
- `setState()` should be treated as asynchronous

## Read: [RTL Testing Example](https://thomlom.dev/beginner-guide-testing-react-apps/)

- AAA pattern *Arrange (set up the test), Act (trigger the necessary event), Assert (compare the expected outcome)*
- `jest-dom` library that adds declarative matchers to jest for use with React
  - To install: $ `npm i @testing-library/jest-dom`
  - Import the package to extend the Jest matchers: `import "@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect"

## Read: [RTL Testing Example](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/example-intro/)

- Provides a library of React testing examples
