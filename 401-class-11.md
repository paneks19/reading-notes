# Code 401: Class 11 - Event Driven Applications

***

## Questions

1. Why is access control important? 
*Access control helps to prevent users from accidentally or intentionally doing damage to the application or system. Users are granted limited privileges based on what they minimally require to complete their tasks.*

2. Describe an application that would need access control.
*The nuclear launch controls. Only the President is given the credentials allowed to initiate launch. Then there are a few high ranking officials that have access to the system so they can support the president in its use, without having the capability to use it themselves. Below them there would be users that are tasked with maintaining a specific part of the system without access to it in its entirety.*

3. What is a role used for?
*A role is used to define a users set of permissions*.

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
*Role based access control is more scalable because a new employee can be assigned a role and instantly be granted the same permissions as any other employee with the same role. Updating a role will updated permissions for all related users. Changing a user to another role would also update their permissions.*

## Vocabulary

Authorization *User credentials that confirm their permissions for a site or application.*

Role Based Access Control *A method of setting and assigning permissions based on a users relationship to the site or app.*

Capabilities *The rights a user is granted in regard to site access and manipulation.*

- Event Driven Programming *a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our program to avoid complexity and collisions*
- Event handler *callback function that is called when an event is triggered*
- Main loop *primary logic listening for event triggers*
- EventEmitter *built in module to allow for interaction with events*
  - `const EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;`
  - `const myEventEmitter = new EventEmitter;`
