***

## Read: JS Chapter 10

Execution Contexts

- Global Context *code in the script, but not in a function*
- Function Context *code run within a function*
- Global Scope *variable declared outside a function, can be used anywhere*
- Function-Level Scope *variable declared within a function can only b used within that function*

Error Objects

- Property Description
  - `name` type of error
  - `message` description
  - `fileNumber` name of the JS file
  - `lineNumber` line number error
- Object Description
  - `Error` generic error
  - `SyntaxError` syntax has not been followed
  - `ReferenceError` tried to reference a variable that is not declared or outside the scope
  - `TypeError` unexpected data type that cannot be coerced

List of Chrome Browser Errors and their definitions on page 460

Debugging Workflow

- Where is the problem *start at the point of the error and work backwards to narrow down the cause*
- what exactly is the problem 

Typing into the Chrome console

- can type code directly into the console
- variables are stored until the console is cleared
- the "no entry" sign clears the console

Console Methods

- `console.log('Example');` Prints "Example" to the console without any symbols
- `console.info('Example');` Prints "Example" to the console with an info symbol
- `console.warn('Example');` Prints "Example" to the console with a warning symbol
- `console.error('Example');` Prints "Example" to the console with an error symbol
- `console.table();` Output tables showing objects, and nested arrays
- `console.assert();` test if a condition is met and write to the console only if expression evaluates to false

Breakpoints

- Sources tab, click a line to set a break point the refresh page to run code up to that point, hovering over a variable in the code will display its current value at the break point

Debugger Keyword

- `debugger` keyword that when placed in code will stop the interpreter at that line of code if the developer tools are open, can be placed inside a conditional statement so that code is only paused if certain situation is present

Handling Exceptions

- Try *first try specific code*
- Catch *if try code block fails it is passed to the catch code block and attempts another option or indicates the error to the user*
- Finally *if neither of the first two options succeed, run this code which is intended to work in all situations*
