## Questions

1. Array.map() *takes an array and creates a new array with the results of a function called on every element of the original array*

2. Array.reduce() *produces a single result from running a function on each element of a given array*

3. Superagent()

4. Promise *a promise allows an asynchronous to provide a temporary result inline which is then defined when the promise is resolved* 

5. Callback Functions *not all callback functions are asynchronous, typically asynchronous functions pull in information from outside processes or resources*
