***

## Read: [The Call Stack defined on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack)

- Call Stack *mechanism for the interpreter to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions*
- Functions are added to the call stack in the order that they are invoked, as functions are executed they are removed from the call stack until the stack is empty at which all script has been run.
- If the number of function calls exceed the space limit allotted to it, it will result in an "stack overflow" error
