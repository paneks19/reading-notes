JavaScript *used in browsers to make websits more interactive*

- Access Content *can be used to select the contents of a specific element*
- Modify Content *can be used to change content in an element*
- Program Rules *create a set of steps for the brower to follow to access and modify content*
- React to Events *specify when a script should run*

Script *a seriese of instructions a computer can follow to achieve a goal*

- Writing a script
  1. Define the goal
  2. Design th script *split the goal into a series of tasks*
  3. Code each step

Vocabulary *words that computers understand*

Syntax *how teh words are put together to create instructions that computers can follow*

Computers solve problems proramattically, following a series of instrucitons, one step after another

Expressions evelauate into a singlge value

- First type are expressions that just assign a value to a variable
  - Example: `var color = 'beige';` *The value of color is now beige*
- The second type are expressions that  use two or more values to return a single value
  - Exampele: `var area = 3 * 2` *The value of area is now 6*

Operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values

- Assignment operators *assign a value to a variable
  - Example: `var color = 'beige';` *The value of color is now beige*
- Arithmetic operators *perform basic math*
  - Example: `area = 3 * 2` *The value of area is now 6*
- String Operators *combine two strings*
  - Example: `greeting = 'Hi ' + 'Molly';`
- Comparison Operators *compare two values and return true or false*
  - Example: `buy = 3 > 5;` *Value of buy is now false*
- Logical Operators *combine expressions and return true or false*
  - `buy = (5>3) && (2<4);` *The value of buy is now true*

Arithmetic Operators *JS contians the standard operators `+, -, /, *` which can be used with numbers as well as the following special operators*

- `++` *(Increment) adds one to the current number*
- `--` *(Decrement) subtracts one from the current number*
- `%` *(Modulus) devides two values and returns the remainder example: `10 % 3 = 1`*

String Operator *just one operator `+` used to join strings on either side*
 
- Concatenation *the joining of two or more strings to form one new string*

Mixing numbers and strings

- Quotes around a number (`#`) create a string, not a numberic number type. Arithmetic operators cannot be used on strings
  - Example: `'2' + '2' = '22'` *Adding strings concatenates them, it does not add.*
  - Example: `12 + 'Bob' = '12Bob'` *Adding a number to a string, creates a new concatenated string*
  - Example: `'seven' * 'nine' = NaN` *(Not a Number) attempting to use arethmetic operators on strings will return a value called NaN*
