# Code 401: Class 31 - Hooks API

***

## Questions

1. Why do we need more .html pages in a multi-page React app? *"Single page websites cannot always represent complete information" - Techomoro, Syamlal CM*

2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why? *Create a layout component*

3. What does props.children contain? *Whatever you include in between the opening and closing tags* 

## Vocabulary

- Composition *Combining multiple components to achieve a particular goal*
- Children *Allows you to pass components as data to other components*
- Hash Routing *"A URL that has a unique application endpoint `/app/` controlled by one single back-end action and multiple hashtags managed by JavaScript that define the SPA routes" - ITNEXT.io, Ideneal*
- Link Routing *"The primary way to allow users to navigate around your application" - React Router Docs*

## Read: [Making Sense of React Hooks](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889)

- Hooks let you always use functions rather than a mix of functions classes, higher-order components, and render props
- Adding hooks does not introduce any breaking changes
- Hooks don't share state they share stateful logic
- Hooks are a vision of the future of React at FB

## Read: [Using the state hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)

- `import React, { useState } from 'react';
- Calling useState declares a state variable that does not disappear after the function exits
- useState returns the current state and  a function that updates it

## Read: [Hooks at a glance](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)

- Hooks don't work inside classes, but they can replace the need for classes
- Hooks are functions that let you hook into  React state and lifecycle features
- `useEffect` runs your effect function after flushing changes to the DOM, runs after every render
- Rules of Hooks
  - Only call hooks at the top level, don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
  - Only call hooks from React function components

## Read: [Hooks API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)

- "Bailing out of a state update" if you update a state hook  to the same value as the current state, will not render children or firing effects

## Read: [Using the effect hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)

- Effect Hook allows you to perform side effects in function components
- Can pass a second argument to the useEffect() as an array that will prevent unnecessary re-renders
