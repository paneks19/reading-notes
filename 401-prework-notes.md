## Read: [Solving Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

- Solving code problems in an interview
  - Spend time up front planning how to approach the problem
  - Build a simple solution first then add complexity
  - Suggested steps
    1. Read the problem twice
    2. Solve manually with 3 sets of sample data
    3. Optimize the manual steps
    4. Write the manual steps as comets or pseudo-code
    5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code
    6. Optimize the real code
  - Know how to do the following in any language that you may be tested on 
    1. Create a list
    2. Sort a list or array
    3. Create a map or dictionary
    4. Loop through a list or dictionary
    5. Parse strings
    6. Convert from string to int, int to string
  - If a code challenge has many complex parts "divide and conquer"

## Read: [Act like you make $1000/hr](https://medium.com/swlh/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-f04628bb3e6d)

- The premise of this article is that by valuing one's time at $1,000 per hour one will focus on doing things that are actually important.  The author suggests that many "busy" people are busy by choice and to their detriment.  A number of successful professionals are quoted as saying something to the effect of refusing 90+% of opportunities that are presented to them. The major take-away is to learn to say "No" more often.

## Read: [How to think like a programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)

- This article presents a systematic approach to problem solving
  - Understand *determining exactly what the problem is*
  - Plan *don't start writing code without first thinking through the steps in the solution, possibly comment the solution first*
  - Divide & Conquer
  - When stuck, go line by line and figure out exactly what you told the computer to do not what you wanted it to do
  - Practice in all forms
  
## Read: [The 5 Whys](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

- 5 Whys developed by Sakichi Toyoda (founder of Toyota)
- Best suited to simple or moderately complex problems
- Steps
  - Gather a team that is familiar with the problem
  - Define the problem
  - Ask the first "Why"
  - Ask four successive "why's" each relating to the answer to the previous question
  - Stop asking "why" when there are no additional useful responses
  - Address the root cause
  - Monitor the solutions to confirm they are working
