- open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React
- "Views" are the building blocks of iphone and android apps
- React native allows for developing "native apps" that would otherwise be written in Kotlin or Java for Android and Swift or Obective-C for iOS
- Core components, essential ready to use native components already built and available

## Read: [React Native Basics](https://reactnative.dev/docs/tutorial)

- `import { Text, View } from 'react-native';`
- Native components: `View`, `Text`, `Image`, `Button`, `StyleSheet`

## Read: [Expo](https://expo.io/)

- Expo: framework and platform for universal React applications, set of tools built around React Native used to develope and deploy iOS, Android, and web apps
- $`npm install -g expo-cli`
- $`expo init my-project`
- `expo eject` expo-cli will expose the underlying native projects and configurations
- [Expo Go](https://expo.io/tools#client)
- [Android Studio Emulator](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- $`expo install`
- $`npx expo-optimize` will make assets a bit more lean, republish after
- set a `bundleIdentifier` in `app.json`
- $`expo upload:ios` to send project to app store
- [Application Loader](https://help.apple.com/itc/apploader/) another way to deploy to app store
- [More about deploying to App Store](https://docs.expo.io/distribution/app-stores/)
- Must build an [Android App Bundle](https://developer.android.com/platform/technology/app-bundle) for the Play Store
- Android also needs a `package` inside the `app.json`
- $`upload:android` after first upload to Google Play Console subsequent uploads can be done with this command
- Installing:
