# Code 401: Class 38 - Redux Asynchronous Actions

***

## Questions

1. How granular should your reducers be? *In most cases it will probably be beneficial to have a unique reducer for each action so that it be reused in other processes*

2. Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched *In most cases this is probably a con because it would be difficult to make independent changes if necessary*

3. Name a strategy for preventing the above *Separate out the actions so each calls a specific reducer*

## Vocabulary

- Store *the top level storage of all state in Redux*
- Combined Reducers *a single reducer that takes in two or more other reducers and returns a single function*
