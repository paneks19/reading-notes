- `{background-image: url("path");}` Place a background image in an element
- `background-repeat: repeat-x;` Background image repeats in the x direction only 
- `background-repeat: repeat-y;` Background image repeats in the y direction only 
- `background-repeat: repeat;` Background image repeats in both directions
- `background-repeat: no-repeat;` Background image does not repeat
- `background-attachment: fixed;` Background image does not move on scroll 
- `background-attachment: scroll;` Background moves on scroll 
- `background-position: center-top;` Background image is set to center top, can also be `left top`, `right top`, `left center`, `center center`, `center right`, `bottom left`, `bottom center`, `bottom right`
  - can also use px dimensions or % from top left, `background-position: 50% 50%;` would center the picture in the window
- can stack images in the background by listing more urls
- Image Rollovers and Sprites
  - Sprite *single image that is used for several different parts of an interface*
- Background gradients
