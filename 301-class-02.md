- jQuery *simple way to achieve variety of common JavaScript tasks, a JavaScript file that lets you find elements using CSS-style selectors and then do something with them using a jQuery method*
  - Select elements easier than DOM query
  - Perform tasks like updating DOM
  - Handle Events
- Find elements using css-style selectors: `$('li.hot')`
  - `'li.hot'` *selector, that refers to all of the `<li>` elements with a class of `hot`*
- Update the value of a class attribute: `$('li.hot').addClass('complete');`
  - `.` *Member Operator, indicates that the method on the right should br used to update the elements on the left*
  - `.addClass('complete');` *Method, this method refers to the class attribute and adds the parameter value `complete`*
- Must link jQuery to your html
  - Example = 

  ```html

    </div>
    <script src="js/jquery-1.11.0.js"></script>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </body>

  ```

- jQuery Getting and Setting Data
  - For the following examples, assume there are multiple `<li>` elements in the file:

  ```JavaScript

  var content = $('li').html(); //will select the first `<li>` element and assign its content to the new variable `content`

  $('li').html('updated'); //will update the contents of all `<li>` elements with the word "updated"

  ```

- Looping through similar elements *when a selector returns multiple elements, you can update all of them using one method with no need to loop*
- Chaining *process of placing several methods in the same selector using dot notation to separate each*
  - `$('li[id!="one"]').hide().delay(500).fadeIn(1400);`
  - This single line hides the selected elements, creates a pause, and fades in the elements
- jQuery's `.ready()` method checks that the page is ready for your code to work with

```js

$(document).ready(function(){
  //your script goes here
});

//Shortcut version of same function below
$(function(){
  //your script here
});

```

- *Confirms that the DOM has been created before attempting to run the desired script*
- Getting Element Content
  - `.html()` *retrieves only the content of the first element in the matched set*
  - `.text()` *retrieves all text from the selected elements and their descendants*
- Updating Elements
  - `.html()` *gives every element in the matched set the same new content which may include html*
  - `.text()` *gives every element in the matched set the same new text, any markup would be shown as plain text*
  - `.replaceWith()` *replaces every element with the new content and returns the replaced elements*
  - `.remove()` *removes all of the elements in a matched set*
- Changing content
  - Can update the content of an element with a string, variable, or a function
  - When specifying new content: use single quotes to surround the content and double quotes for the attribute values

- Greater Efficiency *research shows that pair programming may take slightly longer, but will produce higher quality code with less debugging and implementation time*
- Engaged Collaboration *pair programmers tend to be more focused and are able to assist each other with less outside assistance required*
- Learning from Fellow Students *the less experienced partner gains knowledge and the other learns through teaching*
- Social Skills *pair programming forces good communication and team work*
- Job Interview Readiness *simulates a situation that is often experienced during industry interviews*
- Work Environment Readiness *simulates the work environment*
