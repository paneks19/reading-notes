# Code 301: Class 02 - Reading Name

***

## Read: JS Book 293-301, 306-331, & 354-357

- jQuery *simple way to achieve variety of common JavaScript tasks, a JavaScript file that lets you find elements using CSS-style selectors and then do something with them using a jQuery method*
  - Select elements easier than DOM query
  - Perform tasks like updating DOM
  - Handle Events
- Find elements using css-style selectors: `$('li.hot')`
  - `'li.hot'` *selector, that refers to all of the `<li>` elements with a class of `hot`*
- Update the value of a class attribute: `$('li.hot').addClass('complete');`
  - `.` *Member Operator, indicates that the method on the right should br used to update the elements on the left*
  - `.addClass('complete');` *Method, this method refers to the class attribute and adds the parameter value `complete`*
- Must link jQuery to your html
  - Example = 

  ```html

    </div>
    <script src="js/jquery-1.11.0.js"></script>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </body>

  ```

- jQuery Getting and Setting Data
  - For the following examples, assume there are multiple `<li>` elements in the file:

  ```JavaScript

  var content = $('li').html(); //will select the first `<li>` element and assign its content to the new variable `content`

  $('li').html('updated'); //will update the contents of all `<li>` elements with the word "updated"

  ```

- Looping through similar elements *when a selector returns multiple elements, you can update all of them using one method with no need to loop*
- Chaining *process of placing several methods in the same selector using dot notation to separate each*
  - `$('li[id!="one"]').hide().delay(500).fadeIn(1400);`
  - This single line hides the selected elements, creates a pause, and fades in the elements
- jQuery's `.ready()` method checks that the page is ready for your code to work with

```js

$(document).ready(function(){
  //your script goes here
});

//Shortcut version of same function below
$(function(){
  //your script here
});

```

- *Confirms that the DOM has been created before attempting to run the desired script*
- Getting Element Content
  - `.html()` *retrieves only the content of the first element in the matched set*
  - `.text()` *retrieves all text from the selected elements and their descendants*
- Updating Elements
  - `.html()` *gives every element in the matched set the same new content which may include html*
  - `.text()` *gives every element in the matched set the same new text, any markup would be shown as plain text*
  - `.replaceWith()` *replaces every element with the new content and returns the replaced elements*
  - `.remove()` *removes all of the elements in a matched set*
- Changing content
  - Can update the content of an element with a string, variable, or a function
  - When specifying new content: use single quotes to surround the content and double quotes for the attribute values
- Inserting Elements
  - Creating a new element: `var $newFragment = $('<li>');` *creates a new jQuery object that contains an empty `<li>` element*
    - `var $newItem = $('<li class="new">item</li>');` *creates a new jQuery object that contains an empty an `<li>` element with a class attribute and some text*
  - Adding the new elements:
    - `.before()` *inserts content before the selected element*
    - `.after()` *inserts content after the selected element*
    - `.prepend()` *inserts content inside the element after the opening tag*
    - `.append()` *inserts content inside the element before the closing tag*
  - Getting and setting attribute values:
    - `.attr();` *method can get or set a specified attributer and its value. To get specify name of attribute in `()`. To set specify both attribute name and new value*
    - `.removeAttr()` *removes attribute by name specified in `()`*
    - `.addClass()` *adds a new value to the existing value of the class attribute, does not overwrite*
    - `.removeClass()` *removes a value from the class attribute, leaving others unchanged*
  - Getting and setting CSS properties:
    - `var backgroundColor = $('li').css('background-color');` *declares a variable and assigns it the value of the background color of the `<li>` element*
    - `$('li').css('background-color', '#272727')` *sets the background color for all `<li>` elements to the color #2727272*

    ```js

    $('li').css({
      'background-color': '#272727',
      'font-family': 'Courier'
    }) //Sets the background color and font family for all `<li>` elements

    ```

    - Working with an element in a selection:
      - `.each()` *performs one or more statements on each of the items in the selection of elements that is returned by a selector*
      - `this` or `$(this)` *keyword to access the current element*

      ```js

      $('li').each(function(){
        var ids = this.id;
        $(this).append('<em class="order>' + ids + '</em>');
      }) //selection contains all `<li>` elements, `.each()` applies same code to all elements, function run for each item

      ```

      - Event methods:
        - `.on()` *method used to handle all events*

        ```js

        $('li').on('click', function(){
          $(this).addClass('complete');
        }); //selects all `<li>` elements, listens for click event which triggers the function to add a class of "complete"

        ```

- Content Delivery Network (CDN) *series of servers spread around the world that serve static files*
  - Should place the `<script src"js/sample.js"></script>` just before the closing `</body>` tag

- Greater Efficiency *research shows that pair programming may take slightly longer, but will produce higher quality code with less debugging and implementation time*
- Engaged Collaboration *pair programmers tend to be more focused and are able to assist each other with less outside assistance required*
- Learning from Fellow Students *the less experienced partner gains knowledge and the other learns through teaching*
- Social Skills *pair programming forces good communication and team work*
- Job Interview Readiness *simulates a situation that is often experienced during industry interviews*
- Work Environment Readiness *simulates the work environment*

- Effects
  - Basic Effects
    - `.show()` *displays selected elements*
    - `.hide()` *hides selected elements*
    - `.toggle()` *toggles between showing and hiding selected elements*
  - Fading Effects
    - `.fadeIn()` *fades in selected elements*
    - `.fadeOut()` *fades out selected elements*
    - `.fadeTo()` *changes opacity of selected elements*
    - `.fadeToggle()` *hides or shows selected element, opposite of current state*
  - Sliding Effects
    - `.slideUp()` *hides selected elements with a sliding motion*
    - `.slideDown()` *shows a selected element with a sliding motion*
    - `.slideToggle()` *hides or shows with a sliding motion, opposite of current state*
  - Custom Effects
    - `.delay()` *delays execution of subsequent items in queue*
    - `.stop()` *stops animation if currently running*
    - `.animate()` *creates custom animation*
      - Example: `.animate({ styles to change } [, speed] [, easing] [, complete])'`
- Finding Elements
  - Pg 302 & 303 list out many of the CSS selectors
  - Pg 304 & 305 list many of the jQuery methods
