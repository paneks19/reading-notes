## Read: [Graphs](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/graphs.html)

- Non-linear data structure
- Collection of nodes or vertices connected by edges
  - Vertex *node that can have zero or more adjacent vertices*
  - Edge *connection between two vertices*
  - Neighbor *nodes that are directly connected by an edge*
  - Degree *number of edges connected to a vertex*
- Undirected Graph *each edge is undirected or bi-directional*
- Directed Graph (Digraph) *every edge is directed, each node points to another specific node*
- Complete Graphs *all nodes are connected to all other nodes*
- Connected Graph *all nodes are connected to at least one other node*
- Disconnected Graph *some vertices may not have edges*
  - Islands *nodes without edges*
- Cycle *a directed graph containing nodes that point to each other in a circle*
- Acyclic *directed graph without cycles*
- Cyclic *a directed graph that cycles*
- Adjacency Matrix *2D representation with an n X n boolean matrix (n = vertices)*
- Sparse Graph *Very few connections*
- Dense Graph *many connections*
- Adjacency List *collection of linked lists or an array that shows a list of all of the vertices linked to each*
- Weighted Graph *graph with edges that have numbers*
- Weighted Graph Matrix *places the weight value in the matrix instead of a boolean*
- Weighted Adjacency List *Places the name and the weight in each node*
- Breadth First Traversal 
  1. `Enqueue` the declared start node
  2. Create a loop that will run while the node still has nodes present
  3. `Dequeue` the first node from the queue
  4. If `Dequeue` node has unvisited child nodes, mark as visited and reinsert them into the queue 
- Depth First Traversal
  1. `Push` root node into a stack
  2. Start while loop while stack is not empty
  3. `Peek` at top node in stack
  4. If top node has unvisited children, mark the top node as visited, then `Push` any unvisited children back into the stack
  5. If top node does not have any unvisited children `Pop` that node off stack
  6. Repeat until stack is empty
