# Code 401: Class 06 - Authentication

***

## Questions

1. Singleton *an object that can only be instantiated one time*

2. How to use singleton pattern with Node modules and classes? *use a constructor to build a class for the singleton that will only allow one instance to be created. Before creating, check to see if one already exists, if so use that one. If not, instantiate.*

3. What approach to use in designing an Express-like middleware? *use the basic format `function myCustomMiddleware(req, res, next){//custom middleware}` then use it by calling `app.use(myCustomMiddleware`*

## Vocabulary

- Router Middleware *allows the developer to modularize all routes, requests are intercepted by the router middleware and redirected to the correct route module*

- Dynamic Module Loading *conditionally importing an module `import('/modules/my-module.js').then((module) => {//do something with module});`*

- Singleton Pattern *allowing only one instance of a class to be constructed*

- CRUD --> REST Method Matches
  - GET --> READ
  - POST --> CREATE
  - PUT --> UPDATE
  - DELETE --> DELETE

- Mock Testing *real dependencies are replaced with objects that simulate the behaviors of the real ones*

## Read: [Securing Passwords](https://thehackernews.com/2014/04/securing-passwords-with-bcrypt-hashing.html)

- hashing is a good way to cryptographically store passwords
- brute force attach can crack a 16 character strong password in about an hour
- hash collision attack, two different inputs that generate the same hash output
- Key Stretching *offered by PBKDF2 and PCrypt* significantly increase the time required for a brute force attack

- Basic Access Authentication * method for HTTp to provide user name and password when making a request*

## Read: [Intro to JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/)

- JSON Web Token (JWT) *open standard for securely transferring json data between parties*
- Can be signed with a secret key or a public/private key
- Standard JWT has three arts separated by `.`: Header, Payload, & Signature: `xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz`
  - Header *contains the type of token and signing algorithm being used (HMAC, SHA256, or RSA)*
    - Example: `{ "alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT" }`
  - Payload *contains three types of claims: registered, public and private*
    - Registered Claims *set of predefined recommended interoperable claims: issuer, expiration time, subject and audience*
    - Public Claims *defined at will by those using JWTs*
    - Private Claims *custom claims created to share info between parties, neither registered or public claims*
    - Example Payload: `{ "sub": "1234567890", "name": "John Doe", "admin": true }`
- Do not put secret info in the payload or header unless it is encrypted
- To create a HMAC SHA256 signature:

```js

HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)

```

- Use [jwt.io Debugger](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io) to decode, verify, and generate JWTs
- Using JWTs
  - When ever a client wants to access a restricted resource they should send  a JWT in the authorization header in the form of a bearer token: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
