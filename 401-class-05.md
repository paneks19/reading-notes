***

## Read: [Linked Lists](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/singly_linked_list.html)

- Sequence of nodes that are connected to each other, each references the next
- Singly *each node has one reference pointing to the next node*
- Doubly *each node references both the previous and next node*
- Next *property on a node that references the following node*
- Head *first node in a list*
- Current *property that indicates which node is currently being viewed*
- `While` loop is the best method for traversing a linked list
- Big O of Linked list
  - Traversing
    - Time = O(n)
    - Space = O(1)
  - Adding a node
    - Time = O(1)
    - Space = O(1)

    Left off at adding a node
