# Code 401: Class 05 - Linked Lists

***

## Read: [Linked Lists](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/singly_linked_list.html)

- Sequence of nodes that are connected to each other, each references the next
- Singly *each node has one reference pointing to the next node*
- Doubly *each node references both the previous and next node*
- Next *property on a node that references the following node*
- Head *first node in a list*
- Current *property that indicates which node is currently being viewed*
- `While` loop is the best method for traversing a linked list
- Big O of Linked list
  - Traversing
    - Time = O(n)
    - Space = O(1)
  - Adding a node
    - Time = O(n)
    - Space = O(1)

- Linear data structure *sequence and order to how they are traversed*
- Dynamic data structure *can shrink and grow in memory to fit the present data*
- Single node *contains data and pointer to next node*
- List goes from Head to null
- Circular linked list *tail of the list (conventionally the head), next node is the beginning of the list*

- Big O *method for evaluating the performance of an algorithm*
  - O(1) function *takes constant time and memory regardless of how many elements are run through an algorithm*
  - O(n) function *linear growth in time and memory as number of inputs grows*
  - O(n^2) function *exponential growth in time and memory as inputs grow*
- To add a node to the beginning of a linked list O(1) constant
  1. Find head node
  2. Make new node, set pointer to current first node
  3. Make head node point to the new node
- To add new node at end of list O(n) linear
  1. Find last node
  2. Make new node and set pointer to null
  3. Make last node point to new node
