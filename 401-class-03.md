# Code 401: Class 03 - Express REST API

***

## Questions

1. Cases where you would want to change the request with custom middleware:
  
- Developer may want to decrypt part of a request prior to passing it to a handler
- Allow the developer to correct an errant request before passing it to a handler
- Middleware can be used to redirect a request to make sure it goes to the correct route

2.The route handler is middleware: False, functions that only use req & res are simply handlers.

3.How can a middleware end a function and send data to the client?

- An example would be an authorization middleware. If the client does not present the correct authorization, the middleware will stop the request cycle and respond with error an error response.

4.At what point in the request lifecycle can you "inject" middleware?

- Middleware can act on the request or response part of the transfer cycle.

5.What causes: "Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response"?

- This occurs when more than one response is attempting to be sent for a request. It can be caused by an unnecessary next().

## Vocabulary

- Middleware *a function that acts on a client request before being received by the route handler*

- Request Object *The request object is used to capture information from the client and deliver it to the server at the time of a client request*

- Response Object *The response object provides the return information that is sent back to the client from the server*

- Application Middleware *A piece of software that intercepts an incoming request prior to hitting its target route. It can perform additional processing, make changes to the request, or reject the request.*

- Test Driven Development *A development model where tests are written before the solution code to help guide and constrain the solution*

- Behavioral Testing *AKA Black Box Testing, tests software by applying inputs and assessing the outputs*

## Read: [Review: ES6 Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

- Classes are templates for creating objects
- Class Declarations

```js

class Rectangle {
  constructor (height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  })
}

```

- Class declarations are not hoisted

- Class Expressions

```js

let Rectangle = class Rectangle2 {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
}

```

- Only one constructor method can be used per class
- `super` keyword can be used to  call the constructor of the super class
- `extends` keyword used to create a class as a child of another class

- Routing *how an app's endpoints respond to client request*
- route paths can be written to include RegEx to allow for more dynamic route matching
