# Code 401: Class 03 - Express REST API

***

## Questions

1. Cases where you would want to change the request with custom middleware:
  
- Developer may want to decrypt part of a request prior to passing it to a handler
- Allow the developer to correct an errant request before passing it to a handler
- Middleware can be used to redirect a request to make sure it goes to the correct route

2.The route handler is middleware: False, functions that only use req & res are simply handlers.

3.How can a middleware end a function and send data to the client?

- An example would be an authorization middleware. If the client does not present the correct authorization, the middleware will stop the request cycle and respond with error an error response.

4.At what point in the request lifecycle can you "inject" middleware?

- Middleware can act on the request or response part of the transfer cycle.

5.What causes: "Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response"?
