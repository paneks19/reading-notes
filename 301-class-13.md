- Forms
  - `action` Defines where the data gets sent
  - `method` Defines how the data is sent
    - `GET` Method used by browser to ask server to send back a specific resource
    - `POST` Method browser uses to talk to the server when asking server to perform an action on the data sent by the client
- Never use `GET` method to transfer a password
- Use `POST` for large amounts of data  
- To send file:
  - Set method to `POST`
  - Set value of `enctype` to `multipart/form-data`
  - Include on eor more `<input type="file'>` to allows user to select the files to be uploaded
- Always escape potentially dangerous characters when gathering form data
