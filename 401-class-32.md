# Code 401: Class 32 - Custom Hooks

***

## Questions

1. What does a component's lifecycle refer to? *The time between mounting and unmounting a component.*

2. Why do you sometimes need to "wrap" functions in `useCallback` when called from within `useEffect`? *Prevents the recreation of a function*

3. Why are functional components preferred over class components? *Functional components are just standard JS functions.*

4. What is wrong with the following code? *Hooks should not be used inside of a loop?*

## Vocabulary

- State hook *`useState(<initial state>)` used to create a state variable*
- Effect hook *Allows you to perform side effects, tells react to do something after the render*
- Reducer hook *Returns the current state paired with a dispatch method*
