Forms *allow you to collection information from the user*

  - `action` links to the page the page on the server that will receive the information
  - `method` can use `get` or `post`, get better for short forms and nonsensitive info, post better for the other
- `id` used to identify the form specifically from other elements
- `size` old tag no longer used, specifies the width of text input boxes in character widths
- `<input type="text" name="username" size="15" maxlength="30"/>` 
  - `type="text"` creates single line text input
  - `name` identifies the form control
  - `maxlength` sets a maximum number of characters that can be entered into the text box
  - `type="password"` acts like a single line text box, but characters are blocked out
-`<textarea>Enter text prompt here...</textarea>` element used to create a multi-line text input
- Radio Button
  - `type="radio"` allows user to pick one of a number of items
  - `value="example"` contains the value that should be sent to the server when selected
  - `checked` indicates which radio button should be preselected on page load

- `{list-style-position: ;}` default is `outside` can be set to `inside` which would bring the point inside of the text box
- Shorthand *allows you to define multiple list-style options on a single line `{list-style: inside circle;}`

Table Properties

How events trigger JS code

- 1. Select element node that you want script to respond to
- 2. Indicate which event on the node will trigger response, "binding"
- 3. State code that should run when event occurs

Event Handlers

- HTML Event Handlers *bad practice*
  - a set of html attributes that triggered actions when specific elements were involved
- Traditional DOM Event Handlers *original specification for the DOM*
  - Allows JS to separated from html
  - Support on all browsers
  - Limitation, can only attach single function to an event
- DOM Level 2 Event Listeners *this is now the favored wat of handling events*
  - one event may trigger multiple functions, reduces potential conflicts

Traditional DOM Event Handler

```js

function checkUsername() {
  //code to check the length of username
}
var el = document.getElementByID('username');
el.onblur = checkUsername;

```

- Lines 112-114: starts by defining the named function
- Line 115: reference to the DOM element node, often stored as a variable
- Line 116: function is called by the event handler on the last line, parentheses omitted

Event Listener

- Syntax example: `element.addEventListener('event', functionName [,Boolean]);`
  - `element` *DOM element node to target*
  - `addEventListener('event, functionName [, Boolean]);` *Method, adds an event listener to the DOM element node*
  - `event` *event to bind nodes to*
  - `functionName` *name of function to call*
  - `[, Boolean]` *indicates something called capture and is usually set to `false`*
  
Event Bubbling *event starts at the most specific node and flows outwards towards the least specific

Types of Events

- W3C DOM Events 
- HTML5 Events
- BOM Events *Browser Object Model*

User Interface Events

- `load` fires when the page has finished loading or other specific nodes that finish loading
- `unload` fires when the webpage is unloading
- `error` fires when browser encounters a javascript error or an asset that is missing
- `resize` fires when teh browser window has been resized
- `scroll` fires when the user scrolls up or down

Focus and Blur Events

- `focus` when an element gains focus, focus event fires for that DOM node
- `blur` when an element loses focus, the blur event fires for that node
- `focusin` same as focus except not supported on firefox
- `focusout` same as blur except not supported on firefox
