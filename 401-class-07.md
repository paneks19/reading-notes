- Open standard
- JWT is used to securely transfer info between two parties
- Digitally signed
- Compact, POST request, HTTP Header
- Format: header.payload.signature
  - Header *json object with algorithm and type of token, base64 encoded*
  - Payload *json object with claims, base64 encoded*
  - Signature *combines encoded header and payload with the secret*

## Read: [Are JWTs Secure](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27301557/if-you-can-decode-jwt-how-are-they-secure)

- This is a link to a stack overflow conversation regarding the functionality of JWT
- Major takeaway: JWT does not concern itself with encryption, it is intended to be transferred via https which will handle the encryption. It's sole purpose is validation.
