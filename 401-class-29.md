# Code 401: Class 29 - Routing

***

## Questions

1. Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent? *Yes, via `this.props`*

2. When a component "wraps" another component, how does the child component's output get rendered? *Child components conditionally render UI based on the state passed to them from the wrapping component*

3. Can a component, such as `<Content />`, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application? *Stateless components can be rendered by other parent components*

4. What trick can a parent use to share all `props` with it's children? *Using the spread operator allows all of a parents props to be passed to its child*

## Vocabulary

- props.children *A property of a parent component that shows all of its children components, can be used render all children*

- composition *Is how one can build components from other components allowing for differing complexity and specialization*

- Install $`npm i react-router-dom`
- `import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';`
- `<Browser Router>` should be used for dynamic websites
- `<HashRouter>` should be used for static sites
- Each router creates a `history` object used to keep track of current location
- Routers only expect a single child, so build an App component to render the other children

## Read: [Browser Router API Docs](https://reactrouter.com/web/api)

- `useHistory` hook gives access to the history instance used to navigate
- `useLocation` hook returns location object representing the current URL
- `useParams` returns an object of key/value pairs of URL parameters
- `useRouteMatch` hook attempts to match current URL
- `<Route>` component is the most important, its job is to render some content when a path matches the current URL
- Routes without a path always match
