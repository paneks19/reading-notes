# Code 401: Class 14 - Event Driven Architecture

***

## Questions

1. What's the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue? *FIFO stands for first in first out which is the same way that a standard queue operates*

2. How Can the server be assured a message was properly received?

3. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

4. How do you test an even driven system? *Logging all events is essential as is distributed tracing*

## Vocabulary

FIFO Queue *Queue in which the first item added to the queue is the first out*

Pub/Sub *Asynchronous messaging service that separates event creation from event processing*

## Watch: [AWS SNS and SQS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXk0MNjlO7A)

- SNS
  - Publisher/Subscriber
  - Publishing messages to a topic that can be delivered to many subscribers
  - If other systems care about an event and you need to publish it out to them use this format
- SQS
  - Queueing system for message processing
  - A system must poll the queue to discover new events
  - Messages in a queue are typically processed by a single customer
  - If your system cares about an event use this format

## Watch: [Azure Event Hubs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDDjFQSQyF4)

- This video is a discussion of different azure features

## Read: [FIFO Queues withing AWS and Azure](https://vunvulear.medium.com/fifo-and-queues-inside-aws-and-azure-d21145473d5a)

- AWS SQS default is not FIFO
- AWS cannot send message from AWS SNS to FIFO SQS
- Azure Queue Storage does not have support for FIFO
