# Code 401: Class 12 - Socket.io

***

## Questions

1. What is the benefit of transforming data into packets? *Splitting the data allows each piece to be sent independent of the others and reassembled on the receiving end which allows for more network flexibility.*

2. UDP is often refereed to as a connections protocol. Why? *UDP does not require a server and client to establish a three-way handshake prior to transmission.*

3. Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections? *Yes, using socket.io*

4. Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers? *Yes, as long as each connection is associated with a different client IP/Port.*

5. Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection? *Not if they are intended to be used at the same time on the same port.*

## Vocabulary

Observer Pattern *Software design pattern where an object notifies its dependents automatically of any state changes*

Listener *An object or function that is activated by a specific event*

Event Handler *Function that responds or processes an event*

Event Driven Programming *Programming in which the flow of the processes are determined by events such as user input*

Event Loop *Programming construct that waits for and dispatches events*

Event Queue *Where events are stored prior to execution*

Call Stack *Where functions are stored prior to execution*

Emit/Raise/Trigger *Methods for triggering an event*

Subscribe *Similar to .then()*

Database *Data storage structure*

## Watch: [OSI Model Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv4y_uOneC0)

- Open System Integration Model (OSI Model)
  - Application layer *Used by network applications, use HTTP or HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, Telnet*
  - presentation layer *Receives data from application layer, in terms of numbers and letters and translates to binary. Data compression occurs here, encryption also occurs here, SSL (Secure Socket Layer)*
  - Session layer *Sets up and manages connections, API's, NETBIOS, Authentication occurs here, Authorization occurs here, data transferred via data packets*
  - Transport layer *Segmentation - splits data into smaller segments, Flow Control - controls amount of data transfer speed, Error control, checksum used to check for corruption, TCP, UDP*
  - Network layer *Sends packets via logical addressing, ip addressing, routing, path determination, OSPF*
  - Data Link layer *Access the media via Framing, controls how data is placed for media, LAN Cable, Optical Fiber, Wifi*
  - Physical layer

## Watch: [TCP Handshakes Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtP5ZB3wSk)

- TCP *Transmission Control Protocol*
  1. SYN segment set to server
  2. Server replies with SYN-ACK
  3. Client replies with ACK
  4. Two connection is established

## Read: [Web Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

- WebSocket *communications protocol over single TCP*

## Read: [Socket.io Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket.io/)

- Socket.io  *enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication, built on top of web sockets API and node.js*
- This site offers a tutorial to help users build "moderately complex real-time websites, back-ends for mobile applications, and push notifications" 
- Socket.io is a JS library for real-time web apps
- `$npm i socket.io` *to install in a directory*

## Read: [Socket.io vs Web Sockets](https://www.educba.com/websocket-vs-socket-io/)

- WebSocket remains open all of the time to allow for realtime transfer, event driven
- Socket.io is a library that allows for full duplex communication, event driven
- WebSocket protocol schema `ws://example.com:4000/chatroom.php`
  - `ws://` *Schema*
  - `example.com` *Host*
  - `:4000` *Port*
  - `/chatroom.php` *Server*
- Socket.io allows for broadcasting multiple sockets at the same time
