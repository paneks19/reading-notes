Adding Images

- `<img>` *empty tag that must carry the following 2 attributes*
- `src` Source *path to location of image, typically a relative location*
- `alt` Alt Text *provides a description of the image if you cannot see it*
- `title` Title *provides additional info about the image when user hovers over it with mouse*
- `height` *specifies the height of a picture in pixels, typically set with CSS not html*
- `width` *specifies width of picture in pixels, now typically set with CSS not html*
- `<figure>` *tag to contain an image with its caption*
- `<figcaption>` *add a caption to an image so they are associated with one another*

3 Rules of Creating Images

- Choose the right file type
  - jpeg
    - good for pictures with many different colors
  - gif
    - good for images with only a few colors or flat colors like a logo
  - png
    - good for images with only a few colors or flat colors like a logo
- Save at the right size
  - save at the same size as is intended for the web display
  - measure images in pixel dimensions
- Vector images
  - Benefit is that they can be scaled without quality loss
- Animated gifs show a sequence of static images that appear to have basic animation
- Transparent gif
  - Can be used if edges are straight *and normal to the browser window* if the transparent portion is 100% transparent
- Transparent PNG 
  - Must be used if transparent edges are diagonal, round, shadowed, or not 100% transparent

To determine current dimensions of an image on the web *right click open in new tab, the dimensions will be displayed in the tab*

Color *the `color:` property allows you to specify text color in an element*

- RGB Values *express colors in terms of how much red, green, and blue are used `rgb(100,100,90)`
- Hex Codes *express the color using six-digit code representing amount of red, green, and blue in a color preceded by a `#`, example: `#ee3e80`*
- Color Names *there are 147 predefined named colors, example: `DarkCyan`*

CSS Comments *developer notes that will not effect the code*

- Place comments between `/*comment*/`

Background Color *background color is set to transparent by default, most browsers show white, but not always*

``` css
body {
    background_color: rgb(200,200,200):}
```

Opacity *allows developer to set the opacity of an element and its children, values from 0.0 to 1.0*

- To set opacity, indicate a color in `rgba`, example: `rgba(231,112,56,0.5)`

HSL Colors *defines a color in three terms: hue, saturation, and lightness*

- Hue *colloquial idea of color, often shown as a color wheel indicated by degrees 0-360*
- Saturation *amount of gray in a color, 100% is full saturation, 0% is a shade of gray*
- Lightness *amount of white or black in a color, 0% Lightness is black, 100% Lightness is white, 50% is normal. AKA Luminosity*
- HSLA *adds the alpha value for transparency from 0 to 1.0*

Typeface Terminology

- Serif *detail on bottom of letters thought to make longer text easier to read, but require higher resolution than most screens*
- Sans-Serif *with lower resolution screens, easier to read*
- Monospace *font that uses letters that all take up the same width, used by many code editors because it lines up well*

Default text size in browser is 16px. Can use percentages to scale the text based on 16px = 100%

@font-face *allows you to use a font that is not installed on the browsing computer*

```css

@font-family {
    font-family: 'ChunkFiveRegular';
    src: url('fonts/chunckfive.eot');
}
h1, h2 {
    font-family: ChunkFiveRegular, Georgia, serif;}
}

```

- `font-family` specifies the name of the font
- `src` path to the font
- `format` format that the font is supplied in

Free font sources

- www.fontex.org
- www.openfontlibrary.org
- www.typekit.com
- www.kernest.com
- www.fontspring.com
- www.google.com/webfonts

Upper and Lowercase

- `text-transform: uppercase;` turns all letters to uppercase
- `text-transform: lowercase;` turns all letters to lowercase
- `text-transform: capitalize` capitalizes first letter in each word
