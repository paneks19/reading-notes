Adding Images

- `<img>` *empty tag that must carry the following 2 attributes*
- `src` Source *path to location of image, typically a relative location*
- `alt` Alt Text *provides a description of the image if you cannot see it*
- `title` Title *provides additional info about the image when user hovers over it with mouse*
- `height` *specifies the height of a picture in pixels, typically set with CSS not html*
- `width` *specifies width of picture in pixels, now typically set with CSS not html*
- `<figure>` *tag to contain an image with its caption*
- `<figcaption>` *add a caption to an image so they are associated with one another*


3 Rules of Creating Images

- Choose the right file type
  - jpeg
    - good for pictures with many different colors
  - gif
    - good for images with only a few colors or flat colors like a logo
  - png
    - good for images with only a few colors or flat colors like a logo
- Save at the right size
  - save at the same size as is intended for the web display
  - measure images in pixel dimensions
- Vector images
  - Benefit is that they can be scaled without quality loss
- Animated gifs show a sequence of static images that appear to have basic animation
- Transparent gif
  - Can be used if edges are straight *and normal to the browser window* if the transparent portion is 100% transparent
- Transparent PNG 
  - Must be used if transparent edges are diagonal, round, shadowed, or not 100% transparent

To determine current dimensions of an image on the web *right click open in new tab, the dimensions will be displayed in the tab*
