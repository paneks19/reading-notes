## Read: "What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

Project Aristotle

- Google set out to determine why some of its groups were very successful while others stumbled
- Assembled a team of statisticians, organizational psychologists, sociologists, and engineers
- The only pattern that emerged was the idea that group norms had a significant impact on group performance
- Beneficial group norms
  - All members speak roughly the same amount
  - Members on average also had higher "average social sensitivity"
- Other traits of successful teams
  - Having clear goals and creating a culture of dependability

## Read: CSS Transforms

`transform` *applied in two different forms 2D and 3D*

- `transform: rotate(20deg)` Rotates an element 20 degrees clockwise
- `transform: scale(.75)` Scales an element to 75% of original
- `transform: translate(-10px, 25%)` Shifts element 10px left and down 25%
- `transform: skew(5deg, -20deg)` Distorts the element 5deg on the X axis and 20deg on the Y
- `transform-origin: 20px, 50px;` Moves the center of rotation of an element 20 px right and 50px down from top left
- `transform: perspective` Used to produce a 3D perspective similar to a vanishing point


## Read: CSS Transitions and Animations

For a transition to occur an element must hav a change in state, easiest way is with a pseudo-class

- Pseudo-Classes
  - `:hover`
  - `:focus`
  - `:active`
  - `:target`
- Most common transition related properties
  - `transition-property`
  - `transition-duration`
  - `transition-timing-function`
  - `transition-delay`
- Animations
  - `@keyframes` rule that sets up an animation
