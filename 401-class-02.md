# Code 401: Class 02 - Express

## Questions

1. PUT vs. PATCH: *A PUT request will replace an entire resource. A PATCH request will make specific changes to part of a resource*

2. Services that allow you to mock an API:
  - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/lp/try-postman/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=display&utm_campaign=10947580463&utm_content=108486446358&utm_term=%2Bmock%20%2Bapi&dcid=7011K000001uSw8QAE&gclid=CjwKCAiAwrf-BRA9EiwAUWwKXhG05b_djD-q9FbHJMhwtAx-B8DIw9IU-XpRdptP6idXftW7lXvsbhoCiCsQAvD_BwE)
  - [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/mock-api-guide/advanced/)
  - [Mockable.io](https://www.mockable.io/)

3. Swagger vs. APIDoc.js: *APIDoc.js is a templating engine that produces API documentation. Swagger performs a similar function by creating a .yml file or .json file that contains relevant information regarding your API*

4. SOAP vs. ReST: *SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) relies on XML messaging. The language being used to implement SOAP can make its use very complicated. ReST (Representational State Transfer) is typically easier to implement with JavaScript because it does not require translation to XML, but rather uses the URL to contain the needed info.

## Vocabulary

- Web Server *Software that stores, processes, and renders content to a client on a front-end webpage*

- Express *A Node web framework that provides functionality for building http routes, integrates with view rendering engines, provides common application settings, adds the option of middleware.*

- Routing *A construct of Express which defines how clients and servers communicate and transfer information*

- WRRC *Web Request Response Cycle - the process by which servers and clients communicate and transfer information*

## Read: # [An introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

- Open-source, cross-platform runtime environment allowing developers to build server-side tools using JavaScript
- Optimized for scalability and throughput
- NPM *Node Package Manager* provides access to reusable package and has best-in-class dependency resolution, can be used to automate part of the build toolchain
- Express is an *unopinionated* framework, it offers much freedom in term of what components can be used together and in what order

## Read: [What is NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm)

- "Worlds largest software registry"
  - Website *search for packages, maintain profiles, create organizations to manage access rights*
  - CLI *Command Line Interface - terminal control of npm*
  - Registry *public database of JS software*
- To share packages privately user must establish a paid account

## Read: [What is TDD](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'tdd))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1))

- TDD *Test Driven Development*
  - Teams that employ TDD claim a reduction in defect rates, time savings during deployment that offset the test construction time, and better code overall, but this has not been confirmed empirically
- Many teams believe that tests should be written before the solution code

## Watch: [CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSv_m3KhUO8)

- CI/CD *Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery*
- Workflow strategy that ensures that everyone's changes will integrate flawlessly
- Develope in such a way that code could be released at any time
- Webhooks are used to message related parties about updates to the codebase

## Preview

1.Things I understand better now

- The definition of CI/CD
- The benefits of testing (although I would still like to see some empirical data)
- The difference between PUT and PATCH

2.Need to learn more about

- Swagger/APIDocs.js
- Creating and implementing tests
- How to better leverage npm

3.Excited to implement

- Either Swagger or APIDocs.js, any tool that automates documentation sounds like a win!
