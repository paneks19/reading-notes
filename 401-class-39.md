# Code 401: Class 39 - Redux - Additional Topics

***

## Questions

1. What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application? *Create an initial state that is immutable.*

2. When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer? *A function*

## Vocabulary

- Middleware *code that extends the functionality of redux*
- Thunk *provides the ability to write actions that return a function, useful for handling side effects and asynchronous actions*

- `configureStore()` provides simplified config options, combine slice reducers, adds Redux middleware, includes Redux-thunk
- `createReducer()` supply a lookup table of action types to case reducer functions, uses `immer` library to let you write simpler immutable updates
- `createAction()` generates an action creator function for the given action type string
- `createSlice()` accepts an object of reducer functions, a slice name, and an initial state value, creates a slice reducer with corresponding action creators and action types
- `createAsyncThunk` accepts an action type string and a function that returns a promise, generates a thunk that dispatches action based on promise
- `createEntityAdaptor` generates set of reusable reducers adn selectors to manage normalized data in the store
- `createSelector` utility from `Reselect` library re-exported for ease of use
- `npm install @reduxjs/toolkit`
