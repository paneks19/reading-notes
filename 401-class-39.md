# Code 401: Class 39 - Redux - Additional Topics

***

## Questions

1. What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application? *Create an initial state that is immutable.*

2. When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer? *A function*

## Vocabulary

- Middleware *code that extends the functionality of redux*
- Thunk *provides the ability to write actions that return a function, useful for handling side effects and asynchronous actions*


## Read: [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

- `configureStore()` provides simplified config options, combine slice reducers, adds Redux middleware, includes Redux-thunk
- `createReducer()` supply a lookup table of action types to case reducer functions, uses `immer` library to let you write simpler immutable updates
- `createAction()` generates an action creator function for the given action type string
- `createSlice()` accepts an object of reducer functions, a slice name, and an initial state value, creates a slice reducer with corresponding action creators and action types
- `createAsyncThunk` accepts an action type string and a function that returns a promise, generates a thunk that dispatches action based on promise
- `createEntityAdaptor` generates set of reusable reducers adn selectors to manage normalized data in the store
- `createSelector` utility from `Reselect` library re-exported for ease of use
- `npm install @reduxjs/toolkit`

## Read: [Redux RTK Tutorial](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/intermediate-tutorial)

- "slice reducer" describes a reducer function responsible for updating a single key/value state
- `createSlice` and `createReducer` wrap function with `produce` from `Immer` library. Can write code that mutates code inside reducer and Immer will return a correct immutably updated result
- `ducks` pattern: "put all action creators and reducers in one file, do named exports of the action creators, and default export of reducer function"

## Read: [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html)

- "a simple, scalable, state management solution"
- `autorun` automatically creates a reaction that runs once and whenever the observable data inside the function changes
- `observer` wrapping used to rerender specific code whenever relevant state changes
- `import { makeAutoObservable } from "mobx"`
- `import { observer } from "mobx-react"`

## Read: [HookState](https://hookstate.js.org/)

- `npm install --save @hookstate/core`
