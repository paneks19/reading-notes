# Code 401: Class 33 - Context API

***

## Questions

1. Describe use cases for `useMemo()` and `useReducer()`. *`useMemo()` will only recompute memoized value if one of the dependencies has changed. `useReducer()` is similar to `useState()` but works better for complex state logic or if the new state depends on the previous*

2. Why do custom hooks need the `use` prefix? *So that it is clear to react if a function needs to maintain all of the hook rules.*

3. What do custom hooks usually do? *Allow for the reuse of stateful logic.*

4. Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications. *`useEffect()` is a good way to have something happen after a render or every render*

5. Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work. *`useFetch()` is a quick way to set up a fetch and provide state for `isLoading`*

## Vocabulary

- Reducer *used to manage state in an application*
