# Code 401: Class 04 - Data Modeling

***

## Questions

1. Advantages to Test Driven Design
  
- Better overall code quality
- Time savings at deployment that offsets the upfront time investment of creating the tests
- Reduction in defect rates

2. beforeEach() *Runs a function before each test to prep something for the test* afterEach() *Runs after every test which allows a developer to run a subsequent function to perform a clean up task after the test*

3. The primary downside of test driven development is that there are significant upfront time costs.

4. ES6 Classes vs. Constructor/prototype classes *primary difference is that classes can extend parent classes which is not possible with standard constructors*

5. ReST (Representative State Transfer protocol) *allows transfer of additional information to be transferred over http in terms of pseudo states*

## Vocabulary

- Functional programming *concept regarding programming using pure functions, preventing side-effects, and reducing mutability*
- Object-oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Encapsulation *individual object's state is kept private in a class, public methods allow for interaction*
  - Abstraction *mechanism that allows for high level interaction*
  - Inheritance *child classes are allowed to use all fields of its parent class as well as add its own*
  - Polymorphism *allows a child class to be treated exactly like its parent class*
- Class *a template for assembling objects*
- `Super` *keyword used to link a child class to its parent*
- `This` *keyword that refers to the particular instance in question*
- Jest *a JavaScript testing framework*
- Continuous Integration (CI) *a development method where frequent smaller code updates are automatically tested and deployed*
- ReST *Representational State Transfer protocol*
- Data model *an abstract representation of real world data in an organized fashion*

## Watch: [sql vs nosql](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS_kXvOeQ5Y)

- SQL (Structured Query Language)
- SQL is relational
- SQL must fit schema
- MongoDB / NoSQL 
  - Name comes from Humongous
  - No strict schema
  - Much more flexible
  - No relations
  - Collections built of documents which look like json
- Big companies often use both
- At very large scale SQL cannot scale horizontally and may hit a theoretical processing limit

## Read: [nosql vs sql](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

- SQL known as relational databases, NoSQL are non-relational or distributed
- NoSQL are document based instead of table based
- Complex queries are better suited to SQL
- NoSQL is better suited to hierarchical data
- NoSQL preferred for big data
- MongoDB *NoSQL that stores data in json like documents with dynamic schema*
  - Very quick for simple queries
  - Horizontally scalable
  - Dynamic schema allows changes to the schema without modifying all existing data

## Read: [nosql modeling techniques](https://highlyscalable.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/nosql-data-modeling-techniques/)

- NoSQL data modeling often starts with application-specific queries
- Designed to answer the question "What questions do I have?"
- May require better understanding of data structures
- Good for hierarchical or graph-like data
- Denormalization can lead to greater total data volume but more efficient querying
