# Code 401: Class 04 - Data Modeling

***

## Questions

1. Advantages to Test Driven Design
  
- Better overall code quality
- Time savings at deployment that offsets the upfront time investment of creating the tests
- Reduction in defect rates

2. beforeEach() *Runs a function before each test to prep something for the test* afterEach() *Runs after every test which allows a developer to run a subsequent function to perform a clean up task after the test*

3. The primary downside of test driven development is that there are significant upfront time costs.

4. ES6 Classes vs. Constructor/prototype classes

5. ReST (Representative State Transfer protocol) *allows transfer of additional information to be transferred over http in terms of pseudo states*

## Vocabulary

- Functional programming *concept regarding programming using pure functions, preventing side-effects, and reducing mutability*
- Object-oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Encapsulation *individual object's state is kept private in a class, public methods allow for interaction*
  - Abstraction *mechanism that allows for high level interaction*
  - Inheritance *child classes are allowed to use all fields of its parent class as well as add its own*
  - Polymorphism *allows a child class to be treated exactly like its parent class*
- Class *a template for assembling objects*
- `Super` *keyword used to link a child class to its parent*
- `This` *keyword that refers to the particular instance in question*
- Jest *a JavaScript testing framework*
- Continuous Integration (CI) *a development method where frequent smaller code updates are automatically tested and deployed*
- ReST *Representational State Transfer protocol*
- Data model *an abstract representation of real world data in an organized fashion*
