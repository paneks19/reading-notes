***

## Read: [Stacks and Queues](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2443160/discussion_topics/10234988)

- Stack *data structure that consists of nodes that each reference the next but not the previous*
- FILO *First In Last Out*
- LIFO *Last In First Out*
- Pushing something in to a stack will place it at the top
- Popping something off of the stack removes the top item
- To Push O(1)
  1. Assign new node's next to current top node
  2. Reassign reference to top node to the new node
- To Pop O(1)
  1. Set a temp to hold the top pointer
  2. Reassign top to next
  3. Remove top node
  4. Clear out temp reference
- To Peek O(1)
  1. Run isEmpty() first to check if the list is empty 
  2. Return the value of the top node
- isEmpty() O(1)
  1. Check to see if the top node is null

- Queue
- Enqueue O(1)
  1. Set rear.next to new node
  2. Reassign rear to new node
- Dequeue O(1)
  1. Create a temp reference that points to the same location as Front
  2. Reassign Front to next
  3. Clear the temp reference
- Peek O(1)
  1. Check isEmpty() first to make sure queue is not empty
  2. Return front value
- isEmpty O(1)
  1. Return true if front = null
