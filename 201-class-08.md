Controlling the Position of Elements

- Normal Flow *block level elements stack on top of one another*
- Relative Positioning *changes the location of the element in question relative to its normal position, does not effect those around it*
- Absolute Positioning *positions the element in relation to its containing element, taken out of normal flow and will move as users scroll*
- Fixed Positioning *positions an element in relation to the browser window, do not impact the position of near by elements, does not move with scroll*
- FLoating Elements *removes from normal flow, allows other elements to flow around it*

Z-index property *determines which box appears on top when out of normal flow and overlapping*

Clearing Floats

- `clear: left;` *left hand side of box should not touch any other element in the same containing element*
- `clear: right;` *right hand side of box should not touch any other element in the same containing element*
- `both`*neither side should touch*

Multi Colum Layout

- use `<div>` for each column
- `width: ###pix;` sets column width
- `margin: ##pix` sets column margin

Typical Screen Sizes

- iPhone 4: 960x640px
- iPad 2: 1024x768px
- 13" MacBook: 1280x800px
- 27" iMac: 2560x1440px

Fixed Width Layouts

- Designs do not change as the browser window size is changed
  - Typically defined in terms of pixel widths and heights

Liquid Layouts

- Stretch and contract to fit the browser window
  - Tend to use percentages to define dimensions
  - Better adapt to varying screen sizes

Layout Grid

- Method used to make multiple pages consistent

CSS Frameworks *provide code for common tasks like creating layout grids*

- www.960.gs

Linking multiple css sheets

- Can link each individually to index.html
  - `<link href="css/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />` *in index.html*
  - `<link href="css/style-1.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />` *in index.html*
- Can import multiple style sheets in the primary style.css file
  - `@import url("style-1.css");` *in primary `style.css`*
