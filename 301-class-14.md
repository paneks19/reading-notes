## Read: [Database Normalization Explained in Simple English](https://www.essentialsql.com/get-ready-to-learn-sql-database-normalization-explained-in-simple-english/)

- Database Normalization *process used to organize a database into tables and columns*
- Tables should be limited to one purpose
- Main reasons to normalize
  - Minimize duplicate data
  - Avoid data modification issues
  - Simply queries
- Modification Anomaly
  - Insert Anomaly *when data cannot be inserted unless additional information is gathered*
  - Update Anomaly *when some of a records data is repeated on other rows, forcing multiple updates to effect a single change*
  - Search and Sort Issues *when desirable selection data is potentially present in multiple columns the queries become more cumbersome*
- Forms of DB Normalization
  - 1st (1NF)
    - Info stored in a relational table
    - Each column containing atomic values
    - No repeating groups of columns
  - 2nd (2NF)
    - Table in 1st normal form already
    - All columns depend on the tables primary key
  - 3rd (3NF)
    - Table is in 2nd normal form already
    - Columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
