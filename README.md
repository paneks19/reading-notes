## Growth Mindset
**Growth mindset** is the concept that intelligence, knowledge, and skill are *not* a fixed quantity and that with most things in life, a focused effort can lead to improvement.

### Self Reminders
1. Challenges are unavoidable, and an opportunity for improvement.
2. There was a time that I did not know anything that I know now.
   1. A few minutes ago I did not know how to make a link to [my slack profile](https://app.slack.com/client/T039KG69K/G01985S2L9M/user_profile/U01AURZ67QB). I do now, although I am guessing that this link may not provide the result for a user other than myslef, since it is taking me to my slack account. \(More to learn!) :exploding_head:
3. Helping others succeed is often a way to ~~suceed~~ succeed for oneself.

```
If I were posting code, it would look like this.

## This looks like *Tic-Tac-Toe*, but it does not allow for user input.

## Read: 01 - Learning Markdown

### Mastering Markdown on GitHub
* Markdown is primarily plain text and allows the creator to stylize the text with minimal use of HTML tags. Special characters such as \* \# or \- indicate a style to be applied to the following item.
* Images are inserted with the format `![Alt text](image path)`
* Links can be created with the format `[Link Text](url)`
* Some common text emphasis options
  1. *Italics* `*text* or _text_`
  2. **Bold** `**text**` or `__text__`
  3. ~~Strike Through~~ `~~text~~`
  4. ~~***Combination***~~ `~~***text***~~`
* Header tags are indicated with `#` = `<H1>`, `##` = `<H2>`, and so on up to `######` for `<H6>`.
* Lists can be created using the following
  1. `*` = Unordered
  2. `-` = Unordered
  3. `+` = Unordered
  4. `1.` = Ordered
  
> To quote a line of text use `>`.

```
To quote a block of text or code, use ``` "fences" before and after.
```

To create a task list use the following
```
- [ ] Item (Incomplete)
- [x] Item (Complete)
```

To create a chart:
Letter|1|2|
---|---|---
A|A1|A2
B|B2|B3

Chart code
```
Letter|1|2|
---|---|---
A|A1|A2
B|B2|B3
```
