Reading Notes for Codefellows

## Growth Mindset
**Growth mindset** is the concept that intelligence, knowledge, and skill are *not* a fixed quantity and that with most things in life, a focused effort can lead to improvement.

### Self Reminders
1. Challenges are unavoidable, and an opportunity for improvement.
2. There was a time that I did not know anything that I know now.
   1. A few minutes ago I did not know how to make a link to [my slack profile](https://app.slack.com/client/T039KG69K/G01985S2L9M/user_profile/U01AURZ67QB). I do now, although I am guessing that this link may not provide the result for a user other than myslef, since it is taking me to my slack account. \(More to learn!)
3. Helping others succeed is often a way to ~~suceed~~ succeed for oneself.
