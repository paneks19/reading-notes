# Code 401: Class 13 - Message Queues

***

## Questions

1. What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why useful? *Bidirectional means that a single port can both receive and send data this allows for asynchronous responses without having to wait for additional requests*

2. Does socket.io use HTTP? Why? *Yes, HTTP is required for the initial handshake to setup the communication*

3. What happens when a client emits an event? *The event gets passed to the server through websockets*

4. What happens when a server emits an event? *A callback function allows us to implement some sort of action on the client end*

5. What happens if a client "misses" an event? How can we mitigate this? *If an event is missed it is ignored. To avoid this have listeners always on and use internal logic to decide if the event is relevant*
