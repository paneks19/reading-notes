  - According to stack overflow: "is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime tha uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library"
- `$node -v` *to check the version of node that is installed, should be v12.14.1 or higher*
- `$npm -v` *to check the version of npm manager installed*
- `$npm init -y` *installs npm locally to specific directory rather than globally*
