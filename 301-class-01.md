# Code 301: Class 01 - Responsive Web Design and SMACSS

***

## Read: Shay Howe's intro to RWD

- RWD *Responsive Web Design*
  - Addresses the fact that mobile web use is likely to surpass desktop usage soon if it has not already happened 
  - Design intended to look good and function well on any size screen
  - Three common components
    - Flexible layouts *using a design grid that is dynamically resize to any width*
      - Formula for finding relative width of a target element: `target/context = result`
    - Media Queries *provide ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances*
      - Example:

        ```CSS

        /* @media Rule */
        @media all and (max-width: 1024px) {...}

        /* @import Rule */
        @import url(styles.css) all and (max-width: 1024px) {...}

        ```

      - Logical operators in Media Queries
        - `and` requires two conditions be met to execute
        - `not` requires one condition not be true to execute
        - `only` requires a specific condition to be true to execute
      - Orientation media feature *determines if a device is in landscape or portrait orientation*
        - `@media all and (orientation: landscape) {...}
      - Mobile First *using styles targeted at smaller view ports as the default styles for a website and use media queries to adjust as viewport grows*
    - Flexible Media *images, videos, and other content need to be scalable along with view port size*
