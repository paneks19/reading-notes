# Code 201: Class 03 - HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

***

## HTML Text: 62-73

Lists

- `<ol></ol>` Ordered List
- `<ul></ul>` Unordered List
- `<li></li>` List Item
- `<dl></dl>` Definition List *usually consists of a series of terms and their definition*
  - `<dt></dt>` Contains the term being defined
  - `<dd></dd>` Definition

Lists can be nested inside one-another

## HTML Text: 300-329

Box Dimensions

- Can be defined in terms of px, %, or ems, % and ems are better in terms of fitting multiple screen sizes
- The `min-width` and `max-width` properties can be used to set bounds on a box size given different screen sizes
  - `min-height` and `max-height` work in a similar fashion
- `overflow` property can be set to `hidden` or `scroll` the first hides any text that doesn't fit in the box, the later adds a scroll bar to give user access

Padding, Border, Margin

- From inside to outside goes in the following order
  - Content
  - Padding
  - Border
  - Margin

Border Width

- `border-width` can be given the following values
  - `thin`, `medium`, `thick`
  - `5px` a specific pixel thickness
  - Can indicate each boarder individually `border-width-top` etc.
  - Can indicate all at once `border-width: 1px 2px 3px 4px` will render the borders in the following order top, right, bottom, left
  - `border-style` can be set to determine the appearance of the border
  - `border-color` sets border color
  - Short hand border `border: 5px dotted red;`

To center a box, set a `width` value then set `margin-left: auto;` and `margin-right: auto;`

Display *`display` property can change an inline element to a block or vice versa

- `display: inline;` causes a block element to act like inline
- `display: block;` causes an inline element to act like a block
- `display: inline-block;` causes block element to flow like inline but retain other block features
- `display: none;` will hide the content of the element 

Visibility

- `visibility: hidden;` leaves a blank place where the element should be
- `visibility: visible` shows an element

Border Radius

- `border-radius: 10px;` gives all 4 corners a radius of 10px, can define each corner individually or in shorthand form
- `border-radius: 10x 20x;` gives an elliptical corner radius, if using short hand indicate all four horizontal values then all vertical values

Arrays *special variable that stores a list of values*

Array *a variable that stores a list of values*

- Programmer does not have to specificity how many variables it will hold
- Declare an array similar to other variables, but assign the value using `[]` and comma separated items
  - Example: `var colors = ['white', 'black', 'custom'];` *this format is known as an **array literal**, this is the preferred method*
  - Example: `var colors = new Array('white', 'black', 'custom');` *this format is know as an **array conductor***
- Can use different data types in the same array
- Items in an array are automatically assigned an *index* number indicating its position, count starts with `0` not `1`
  - From the example above: Index `0` is `'white'`, `1` is `'black'`, and `2` is `'custom'`
- To access a specific item in an array use the form `arrayName[index number]`
  - Example: `var itemThree = colors[2]` *sets variable `itemThree` to `'custom'`*
- Number of items in an array is a property of each array to access it use `arrayName.length;`
  - Example: `var numColors = colors.length;`
- To change a specific value in an array `arrayName[index number] = 'new value';`
  - Example: `colors[2] = 'beige';` *changes the third array item from `'custom'` to `'beige'`*

Switch Statement *a variable given the switch value is used to indicate which code to run*

```js

switch(level) {
    case 'One':
        title = 'Level 1';
        break;
    case 'Two':
        title = 'Level 2';
        break;
    case 'Three':
        title = 'Level 3';
        break;
    default:
        title = 'test';
        break;
}

```

Switch run faster than `if else` statements because they don't have to check all cases, just run until true and then break out

Type Coercion *when data types are changed unexpectedly*

- JS is said to be `weak typing` because of the possibility of type coercion
- Other languages that require a variable to have a specified data type are said to be `strong typed`

Loops

Loops *check a condition, if it returns true a code block will run then will check again, if still true, code block will run again, until no longer true*

- `For` *good for running a loop a specified number of times, uses a counter as a condition*
- `While` *good for running loops that when you don\'t know how many times it should run*
- `Do While` *similar to the `while` loop, but will always run the statements in the curly braces at least once even if the condition evaluates to false*

```javascript

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    document.write(i);
}

```

The preceding loop will write `0123456789` to the page.

- `for` *keyword indicating a `for` loop*
- `(var i = 0; i < 10; i++)` *Condition (Counter)*
- `document.write(i);` *Code to execute during loop*

Loop Counter

- `var i = 0;` Initialization *creates a variable and sets it to 0
- `i < 10;` Condition *loop will continue to run until it reaches a specified number, may also use a variable that holds a number*
- `i++` Update *every time the loop is run it adds one to the counter*

`break;` Exits a loop

`continue;` Causes the loop to stop the current iteration and then update and check the condition again, if true runs loop again

While Loop *will continue as long as the condition in the `()` is `true`*

```js

var i = 1; //set counter to 1
var msg = ' '; // message

//store 5 times table in a variable
while (i < 10) {
    msg += i + ' x 5 = ' + (i * 5) + '<br />;
    i++;
}

document.getElementByID('answer').innerHTML = msg;

```

Loop returns the following:

``` 

1 x 5 = 5
2 x 5 = 10
3 x 5 = 15
4 x 5 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
6 x 5 = 30
7 x 5 = 35
8 x 5 = 40
9 x 5 = 45

```

Do While Loop *statements come before the condition so the code will run at least once*
