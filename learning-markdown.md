### Mastering Markdown on GitHub
* Markdown is primarily plain text and allows the creator to stylize the text with minimal use of HTML tags. Special characters such as \* \# or \- indicate a style to be applied to the following item.
* Images are inserted with the format `![Alt text](image path)`
* Links can be created with the format `[Link Text](url)`
* Some common text emphasis options
  1. *Italics* `*text* or _text_`
  2. **Bold** `**text**` or `__text__`
  3. ~~Strike Through~~ `~~text~~`
  4. ~~***Combination***~~ `~~***text***~~`
* Header tags are indicated with `#` = `<H1>`, `##` = `<H2>`, and so on up to `######` for `<H6>`.
* Lists can be created using the following
  1. `*` = Unordered
  2. `-` = Unordered
  3. `+` = Unordered
  4. `1.` = Ordered
  
> To quote a line of text use `>`.

```
To quote a block of text or code, use ``` "fences" before and after.
```

To create a task list use the following
```
- [ ] Item (Incomplete)
- [x] Item (Complete)
```

To create a chart:
Letter|1|2|
---|---|---
A|A1|A2
B|B2|B3

Chart code
```
Letter|1|2|
---|---|---
A|A1|A2
B|B2|B3
```
