# Code 401: Class 08 - Access Control

***

## Questions

1. When is Basic Auth and Bearer Auth used? *Basic authentication uses user name and a secret while Bearer uses a token. Bearer authentication is more secure.*

2. What does the JWT package do? *JWT is an open source bearer token system for user authentication.*

3. Considerations for making and storing a secret? *Never store un encrypted secrets in .git repositories. Place sensitive files in .gitignore. Default to minimum permissions for API's. Create and use time stamped secrets that have a predetermined expiration. Don't share secrets via messaging services.*

## Vocabulary

Encryption *Method of converting information into a secret code*

Token *More secure form of authentication compared to a password*

Bearer *Clinet that holds a valid token*

Secret *Information known only to the two parties exchanging data*

JSON Web Token *Open source bearer token setup that involves a token with head.payload.signature, the signature verifies the content is received unchanged*

## Watch: [RBAC Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4NP8Eon3cA)

- Role Based Access Control *access privileges based on the role of individual*
- User -> Role -> Rights
- Begin with user authentication, then activate appropriate role, then provide appropriate access
- Implement least privilege concept, minimum access needed to fulfil a role

## Read: [5 Steps to RBAC](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3060780/5-steps-to-simple-role-based-access-control.html)

- 81% of hacking breaches involved compromised credentials
- Other forms of RBAC: ACL (Access control lists) and Attribute-based access control (ABAC) 
- 5 Steps to implementing RBAC
  - Inventory systems *determine which systems need to have controlled access*
  - Analyze your workforce and create roles *minimum number of roles as possible to serve all users*
  - Assign people to roles 
  - Never make one-off changes *change roles as necessary not individual user permissions*
  - Audit *periodically review role definitions and access rights*

## Read: [Wiki - RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)

- RBAC can be used to secure organizations with hundreds of users and thousands of permissions
- A single person would not be allowed to perform opposing roles such as oth creating a login account and authorizing account creatino
