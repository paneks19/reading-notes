# Code 401: Class 30 - Implementation: Hash Tables

***

## Watch: [What is a hash table?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfhjkfocRR0)

- Data structure for storing data
- Key / Value pairs
- Chaining a linked list in each array position prevents collisions

## Read: [Intro to Hash Tables](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-30/resources/Hashtables.html)

- Hash is the result of an algorithm taking in a string and returning a value for security or an index position
- Bucket is an index position in an array, may contain multiple value pairs
- Collisions are when two different strings are hashed to the same index
- Every bucket or node has a key/value pair
- Lookups using hashing can be done in O(1) time complexity
- Standard methods: 
  - `Add()` Send the key to the `GetHash` method, go to that index, check for collision, if not place in index, if collision place in data structure in that bucket
  - `Find` Takes in key and gets hash, goes to index, iterates through looking for a match, returns value
  - `Contains` Accept key, returns boolean if the key exists in hash table, if found returns index
  - `GetHash` Take in key, performs hash, returns index of where key/value should be placed

## Read: [Basics of Hash Tables](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/hash-tables/basics-of-hash-tables/tutorial/)

- Real world examples: student numbers, book dewy decimal system
- Hash function, any function that can map a data set of arbitrary size to a fixed size
  - Ideal functions: easy to compute, evenly distributes results across the hash table
