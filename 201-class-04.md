# Code 102: Class 04 - HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

***

## HTML Text 74-93

Links

- Created using `<a></a>` tags
- `<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>`
  - `<a href="http://www.imdb.com">` *opening link tag*
  - `"http://www.imdb.com"` *page that link takes you to*
  - `IMDB` *text the user clicks on*
  - `</a>` *closing link tag*

URL *Uniform Resource Locator*

- Absolute URL *url that would be typed into a browser to bring up the site*
- Relative URL *url that links internally to another page on the site which does not require as long of an address*

Email Links

- `mailto:` *link that starts up email program and pre-addresses the email*
  - `<a href="mailto:john@example.org">Email John</a>` *clicking on john will open an email addressed to john*

Opening Link in New Window

- `<a href = "http://www.idb.com" target="_blank">IMDB</a>` *clicking on IMDB will open it in a new window*

Linking to other parts of the same page

- All elements should be given a unique id `id="example"`
- `<a href="#example">Link to Example part of page</a>` *clicking the link will take the user to the element with id example*

Linking to specific part of another page

- `<a href="http://www.website.com#id">Website at location with element id</a>` *will take user to website at the location of the element with id*

## HTML Text 358-404

Controlling the Position of Elements

- Normal Flow *block level elements stack on top of one another*
- Relative Positioning *changes the location of the element in question relative to its normal position, does not effect those around it*
- Absolute Positioning *positions the element in relation to its containing element, taken out of normal flow and will move as users scroll*
- Fixed Positioning *positions an element in relation to the browser window, do not impact the position of near by elements, does not move with scroll*
- FLoating Elements *removes from normal flow, allows other elements to flow around it*

Z-index property *determines which box appears on top when out of normal flow and overlapping*

Fixed Width Layouts

- Designs do not change as the browser window size is changed
  - Typically defined in terms of pixel widths and heights

Liquid Layouts

- Stretch and contract to fit the browser window
  - Tend to use percentages to define dimensions
  - Better adapt to varying screen sizes

Layout Grid

- Method used to make multiple pages consistent

CSS Frameworks *provide code for common tasks like creating layout grids*

- www.960.gs

## JS Text 86-99

Functions *allow programmer to group a series of statements together to perform a specific task*

- Calling the function *the act of running the function, when and where it is desired*
- `{code block}` *Code blocks contain a series of related steps contained between two curly braces}*
- Parameters *pieces of information passed to a function*
- Return Value *the output of a function*

Declaring a Function *give it a name and then write its statements needed to achieve its tasks inside the curly braces*

- Function *keyword that declares a function*
- Name *name the function (use camelCase) followed by `()`
- Statements *perform the tasks of the function between the `{}`
- Example:

```javascript

function sayHello() {
    document.write('Hello!');
}

```

- `function` = Function Keyword
- `sayHello()` = Function Name
- `{document.write('Hello!');}` = Code Block

Calling a Function *can execute all of the statements between a functions curly braces with just one line of code in the location that programmer desires*

- Use the function name followed by `();`
- Example: `sayHello();`

Declaring functions that need information *give a function information by providing parameters*

- Parameters *act like variables inside the equation, placed inside the `()` after the function name*

```javascript

function getArea(width,height) {
    return width * height;
}

```

- `width, height` = Parameters *used like variables inside a function*

Calling a Function that needs information *specify the values it should use in the `()` following the name, these values are called arguments*

- Example of arguments as values = `getArea(3,5);`
- Example of arguments as variables =

```javascript

wallWidth = 3;
wallHeight = 5;
getArea(wallWidth,wallHeight);

```

Getting a single value out of a function *"returning a result"*

```javascript

function calculateArea(width, height) {
    var area = width * height;
    return area;
}
var wallOne = calculateArea(3,5);
var wallTwo = calculateArea(8,5);

```

- `wallOne` variable now holds 15
- `wallTwo` variable now holds 40

*Note: when the interpreter hits the return command it goes back to the statement that called it, subsiqent statements in the function would not be processed*

Variable Scope *location of where a variable is declared will effect where it can be used*

- Variable declared inside of a function, it is only valid within that function
- Local variables *those declared inside of a function, only work in the function*
- Global Variables *are stored in memory the entire time the page is open so it may be used across the whole code*




## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

- Greater Efficiency *research shows that pair programming may take slightly longer, but will produce higher quality code with less debugging and implementation time*
- Engaged Collaboration *pair programmers tend to be more focused and are able to assist each other with less outside assistance required*
- Learning from Fellow Students *the less experienced partner gains knowledge and the other learns through teaching*
- Social Skills *pair programming forces good communication and team work*
- Job Interview Readiness *simulates a situation that is often experienced during industry interviews*
- Work Environment Readiness *simulates the work environment*
